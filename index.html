           <p>
               My dogs are my life. Nothing cures a bad day like having a sweet dog to cuddle with! This blog will show everyone how amazing these dogs are, despite being adopted from shelters. People are very quick to judge dogs that come from shelters, but in reality, they're just as amazing as any other dog. Acee, Charlee, and Ash were all rescue dogs that are now living a great, and spoiled life.

                past get her down! She loves food and will eat anything she can get a hold of, but her favourite
                food is apples!

            <h3>Ash</h3>
            <p>
                Ash is the newest addition to the family. Ash doesn't live with Charlee and Acee but they’re
                best friends! Ash is a rescue dog as well. He was rescued all the way from Nashville, Tennesse!
                Ash is a very lazy dog and doesn't enjoy playing too much. He will play as long as you’re playing
                with him. Ash would much rather laying in bed all day while you give him lots of pets!

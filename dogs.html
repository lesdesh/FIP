                Charlee is a 9 year old shepard lab mix. She loves being lazy on the couch and watching
                anything on the television. Despite her lazy nature, she loves to play with her little sister, Acee!
                Her favourite toys are anything soft and plushie. She also enjoys stealing dirty clothing out of hampers to cuddle with.

                Acee is Charlee’s younger sister! Acee is a rescue dog, so her breed is unknown. She is believed
                to be a bully breed mix. Acee is energetic, funny and rambunxious and doesn’t let her bad
                past get her down! She loves food and will eat anything she can get a hold of, but her favourite
                food is apples!

                Ash is the newest addition to the family. Ash doesn't live with Charlee and Acee but they’re
                best friends! Ash is a rescue dog as well. He was rescued all the way from Nashville, Tennesse!
                Ash is a very lazy dog and doesn't enjoy playing too much. He will play as long as you’re playing
                with him. Ash would much rather laying in bed all day while you give him lots of pets!
